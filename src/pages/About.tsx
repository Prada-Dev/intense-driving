            <div className="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-700">
              <p className="mb-6">
                Founded in 2014, Intense Driving UK began with a simple mission: to provide high-quality, 
                professional driving instruction that gets results. What started as a small driving school 
                with just one instructor has grown into Manchester's most trusted driving education provider.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Our success comes from our commitment to student-centered learning. We understand that every 
                student is different â€“ some learn quickly with intensive courses, others prefer a more gradual 
                approach. That's why we offer a variety of course options and match each student with the 
                instructor who best fits their learning style.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're proud to have helped over 2000 students achieve their driving goals, with a 95% 
                first-time pass rate that speaks to the quality of our instruction. But beyond the numbers, 
                what we're most proud of is the confidence and safety skills we instill in every driver who 
                learns with us.
